# Brands Submission Helper

This folder mirrors the file layout required by the Home Assistant brands repo.

## Contents

`custom_integrations/bodega_ble/` contains:

- `icon.png` (256x256)
- `logo.png` (256x256)

No `@2x` assets are included because only 256px renders are available today.

## Submit to home-assistant/brands

1. Clone the brands repo: `https://github.com/home-assistant/brands`
2. Copy the `custom_integrations/bodega_ble/` folder into the repo root.
3. Open a PR with the new assets.

These assets are required for the Home Assistant Integrations UI to show the
custom integration logo/icon.
